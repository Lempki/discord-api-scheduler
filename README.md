# discord-api-scheduler

This is a REST API for scheduling persistent reminders on behalf of Discord bots. Bots register a timed reminder with a delivery destination and the API fires it at the specified time, even if the bot has restarted in the meantime. Reminders are stored in a SQLite database and restored automatically on service startup. This project is based on the [discord-api-template](https://github.com/Lempki/discord-api-template) repository, which provides the core architecture.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/reminders` | Register a new timed reminder. |
| `GET` | `/reminders` | List reminders, optionally filtered by guild or status. |
| `GET` | `/reminders/{reminder_id}` | Get the status and details of a specific reminder. |
| `DELETE` | `/reminders/{reminder_id}` | Cancel a pending reminder. |
| `GET` | `/health` | Returns the service name, version, scheduler status, and pending job count. |

All endpoints except `/health` require a bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

### POST /reminders

```json
{
  "fire_at": "2026-12-24T18:00:00+02:00",
  "channel_id": "123456789012345678",
  "guild_id": "987654321098765432",
  "payload": {
    "message": "Merry Christmas!"
  },
  "webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
}
```

`fire_at` must be an ISO 8601 datetime with a timezone offset. Times are stored and processed internally as UTC. At least one of `webhook_url` or `bot_callback_url` must be provided.

Returns the created reminder including its assigned `reminder_id` and a `status` of `"scheduled"`.

### Delivery

When a reminder fires, the API sends a `POST` request to the configured `webhook_url` or `bot_callback_url` with the following body:

```json
{
  "reminder_id": "...",
  "fired_at": "...",
  "channel_id": "...",
  "guild_id": "...",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

If delivery fails, the API retries up to three times with exponential backoff: 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 10 minutes. After all attempts are exhausted, the reminder is marked as `"failed"` and will not be retried further.

`webhook_url` is the preferred delivery method because it does not depend on the bot process being reachable. `bot_callback_url` can be used when the bot needs to perform additional logic at fire time, such as looking up a role name.

### GET /reminders

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `guild_id` | Filter to a specific Discord server. |
| `status` | Filter by status. Accepted values: `scheduled`, `fired`, `failed`, `cancelled`. |
| `limit` | Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to `50`, maximum `200`. |
| `offset` | Number of results to skip for pagination. Defaults to `0`. |

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose.

Running without Docker requires Python 3.12 or newer.

## Setup

Copy the environment template and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API listens on port `8004` by default. The Docker Compose configuration creates a named volume for the SQLite database so that reminders persist across container restarts.

To run without Docker:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn scheduler_api.main:app --port 8004
```

## Configuration

All configuration is read from environment variables or from a `.env` file in the project root.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_API_SECRET` | Yes | — | Shared bearer token. All Discord bots must send this value in the `Authorization` header. |
| `SCHEDULER_DB_PATH` | No | `/data/scheduler.db` | Absolute path to the SQLite database file. The directory must be writable. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` | Log verbosity. Accepts standard Python logging levels. |
| `DISPATCHER_MAX_RETRIES` | No | `3` | Number of delivery retry attempts before a reminder is marked as failed. |
